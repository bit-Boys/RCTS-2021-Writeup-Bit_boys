The name of this challenge is Roman Encryption so imediatly my mind went to the caesar cipher. When the challenge description said use a name I assumed it was a keyed Caesar.
I went to this website: https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/keyed-caesar-cipher
I tried Caesar, but it didn't work so I tried Julius Caesar. This looked like it had some letters decrypted but not everything. I looked up Caesar full name in google and got
Gaius Julius Caesar which worked as the key to get the flag.

Decoded message: 
Hello Julius,
Thank you for your support,
You can use this key to receive your reward: flag{5ub5t1tut10n_1s_k3y}
